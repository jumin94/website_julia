# My own review

In my process of learning about Machine Learning methods and their applications to Climate Science I encountered many points of view, many different experiences a LOT of enthusiasm and a LOT of exceptisism. Where do I stand now? There is a lot to learn down the ML rabbit hole, and the most interesting findings are related to making these methods interpretable.  

Here is a list of the most interesting papers that I have read on interpretable machine learning methods. 

## Causal discovery 

Runge 

Kretschmer

#Bayesian Networks

### most importantly... what has been useful for my own research was to go trough Bayesian Networks and Causality concepts per se...
