I am evaluating the response of sea surface temperature to global warming and the associated changes in teleconnections from the Indian and Pacific Oceans to the south of South America. 

This is very exciting work because although the multi-model ensemble mean precipitation change in South America is an increase in precipitation, in some particular seasons and under some given storylines this might not be the case and I will be able to explain why.
