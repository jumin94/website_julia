This post is on what I am learning related to Bayesian Networks and their applications to climate science. Development of a bayesian network for further exploration and development of a causal effect network. 

A Bayesian network (also known as a Bayes network, belief network, or decision network) is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of variables and their conditional dependencies via a directed acyclic graph (Pearl )

Last week a colleague recommended this article:

A conclusion to which they are able to arrive is
