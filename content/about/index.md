Hello! My name is Julia Mindlin and I am PhD candidate from University of Buenos Aires (Argentina). I got my masters degree on Geophysics at the National University of La Plata in 2019. Now I work at the Center for Atmospheric and Oceanic Research [CIMA](http://www.cima.fcen.uba.ar/) and my research group is [DIVAR](http://www.cima.fcen.uba.ar/divar.php), which is directed by my supervisor Carolina Vera and where we investigate the Dynamics of the Atmospheric Variability over South America. I am also part of a [research group](https://research.reading.ac.uk/meteorology/people/ted-shepherd/) at University of Reading led by my co-supervisor Prof. Ted Shepherd at University of Reading. I am very lucky to work with these two amazing groups with brilliant supervisors and both PhD candidates and Postdocs  as colleagues. 

I am also a [YESS community](https://www.yess-community.org/) Regional Representative for South America. As part of this community I am the moment organizing a Machine Learning in Earth System Science which is going to be very cool, you can check it out [here](https://www.yess-community.org/yess-learning-groups-on-machine-learning/) registration is open (June-July 2021)!.

I am also a musician and I use almost all my free time to study trumpet,which I am also passionate about.
